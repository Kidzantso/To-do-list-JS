# To do list 
**To do list ðŸ“ƒ using HTML/CSS/JS**

This is an implementation for a simple to do list as my first project in my 50 projects challenge and i decided to start with pure html/css/js to begin this challenge with

+ **First day**
Started by making a form that inputs the tasks and save it in a JSON file and retrieve all the tasks inside the file to show them
to the user and added a complete and delete button to change the state of the task,also added a dark theme for the page so use can switch between both themes

+ **Second day**
Started by making focus mode (25 minutes timer) and (5 minutes break) and added the dark theme to the second page that can be accesed from the first one,also removed both css files and replaced with one css file
also saved the theme in a local storage so it isn't affected by refreshing or navigating between pages
